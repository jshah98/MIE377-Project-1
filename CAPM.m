% intercept alpha.
 X = [ones(N,1) factRet(:,1)];
%Use the closed-form (CF) solution to find the collection of alphas 
% and betas for all assets

%% PART 3: Portfolio optimization
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% For portfolio optimization we need the asset expected returns, mu, and
% the covariance matrix, Q. Therefore, we need the following parameters
% from our regression model
% - alpha (intercept)
% - beta (factor loading)
% - factor expected return
% - factor variance
% - residual variance (i.e., idiosyncratic risk)

% Calculate the residuals

for i = 1:n
    for t = 1:N
    epsilon(t,i) = (returns(t,i)) - (alpha(i) + betaCF(i)*(expExFactRet(1))); 
    end
   end
% Calculate the residual variance with "N - p - 1" degrees of freedom
denom = N -2;
sigmaEp = zeros(n,1);
for i = 1:n
    sum = 0;
    for t = 1:N
       sum = sum + (epsilon(t,i))^2; 
    end
    variance = sum/denom;
    sigmaEp(i,1) = variance;
end


% Calculate the asset expected excess returns, mu
 mu = transpose(alpha) + betaCF*(expExFactRet(1));

% Calculate the diagonal matrix of residuals and the asset covariance 
% matrix
D = diag(sigmaEp);
temp =factRet(:,1);
 Q = var(temp)*betaCF *transpose(betaCF) + D;
