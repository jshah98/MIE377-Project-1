## Equity Portfolios - Model Comparisons I

Created March 2019

Compared portfolios built with CAPM, Fama-French and PCA factor models, and Mean Variance Optimization (MVO) and Cardinality-constrained MVO investment strategies. In total, six portfolios were compared. The PCA factor models performed the best, followed by the French-Fama factor models with the highest annual returns being 12.7%. Additionally, investment strategies using MVO with cardinality constraints have a slightly higher portfolio return than their MVO counterparts that do not have cardinality constraints.
